This is a personal portfolio project designed for high school students in Grades 11–12 at WASS (Western Australian School System).
It includes all the essential sections commonly found in a student portfolio, along with a contact form that sends submitted data directly to a connected Google Sheet.

The goal is to help the school system easily collect and manage student information, while keeping the project structure as simple and organized as possible.

The entire project is built using only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or advanced tools — so that students can read and understand the fundamental building blocks of a website with ease.

Warm regards.
